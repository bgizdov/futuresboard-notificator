# Futuresboard Notificator
This is a simple Python script designed to fetch todayâ€™s profit from the Futuresboard webpage and send notifications to Pushbullet and ntfy.

### Configuration
To get started, copy the .env.example file to a new file called .env. Then, update the environment variables with your domain name and Pushbullet access token and/or ntfy topic name.

```
cp .env.example .env
```
```
FUTURESBOARD_URL=http://mydomain:5000
PUSHBULLET_ACCESS_TOKEN=o.0eXXXXXXXXXXXXX
NTFY_TOPIC=my-ntfy-topic
NAME=binance1
DELAY_MINUTES=60
```

### Starting
You can start the script in two ways:

#### Using host's python
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 send_loop.py
```

#### Using docker
Alternatively, you can use Docker to run the script.
```
docker-compose up
```
